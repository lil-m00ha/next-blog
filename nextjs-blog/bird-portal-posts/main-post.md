The **rosy-faced lovebird** *(Agapornis roseicollis)*, also known as the rosy-collared or peach-faced lovebird, 
is a species of lovebird native to arid regions in southwestern __Africa__ such as the __Namib Desert__. 

A loud and constant chirper, these birds are very social animals and often congregate in small groups in the wild. 
They eat throughout the day and take frequent baths. Coloration can vary widely among populations. 
Plumage is identical in males and females. 

Lovebirds are renowned for their sleep position in which they sit 
side-by-side and turn their faces in towards each other. Also, females are well noted to tear raw materials 
into long strips, "twisty-tie" them onto their backs, and fly substantial distances back to make a nest.
